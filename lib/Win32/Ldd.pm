=head1 NAME

Win32::Ldd - Track dependencies for Windows EXE and DLL PE-files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Win32::Ldd qw(pe_dependencies);

  my $dep_tree = pe_dependencies('c:\\strawberry\\perl\\bin\\perl.exe');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an XS wrapper for the
L<https://github.com/LRN/ntldd|ntldd> library.

It can inspect Windows PE files and extract information about its
dependencies.

=head2 FUNCTIONS

The following function can be imported from the module:

=over 4

=item $dep_tree = pe_dependencies($filename, %opts);

This function returns a tree of hashes representing the dependencies
of the module.

The options accepted by the function are as follows:

=over 4

=item search_paths => \@path

Where to look for DLLs. Defaults to the directories in C<$ENV{PATH}>.

=item recursive => $bool

Indicates whether resolved dependencies should also be inspected for
its own dependencies. Defaults to true.

=item data_reloc => $bool

unknown!

=item function_reloc => $bool

unknown!
